### Overview

#### Why CryptoPatronage Payment System

In early 2022, we started an experiment that would turn into the Shokunin Network, with a core premise that resource distribution in the Kusama Network ecosystem was too centralized and bottlenecked on majority agreement.

#### What is CryptoPatronage Payment System

CryptoPatronage is a platform that helps creators build a membership program by offering their followers exclusive content and a closer connection with their community.

### Project Details

#### For Patrons
Publicly show your support and commitment to your chosen creators.
Have confidence that your support will go directly to a creator with no middleman, and that you will spend no more than you have committed.
Become known to those you support - and potentially be rewarded for it.
We do not yet provide a service to support with cash or credit/debit, so if that is what the creators you support want or need, we are likely not the right solution for them, or you!

#### For Creators
There are many options in the cryptocurrency ecosystem to monetize your work and make an income regardless of where you are and what you do - CryptoPatronage simply tries to provide a more human and considerate approach, based on the needs of real creators, instead of assuming all of your work can be tokenized as an NFT.

CryptoPatronage is similar to token streaming protocols that already exist, but with permissionless discovery that allows potential supporters to discover your profile and support you on-platform, alongside ways to link directly to your profile from off-platform, similarly to our non-blockchain-based equivalents.

By default, we take no platform fees, and you only pay blockchain transaction fees when pulling your earnings from supporters - which, on the networks we operate on, are negligible, even for creators not based in affluent locales.

If you want to have an experience similar to traditional crowdfunding websites, we (will soon) provide automatic payment execution as an always-optional, fee-added service, at a rate that outcompetes all comparable non-blockchain-based equivalents.

### Ecosystem Fit

The CryptoPatronage project will enable all interested parties to track the support and funding dynamics among different creators on the platform, regardless of the blockchain they operate on. It allows following the number of transactions, creators, supporters, ongoing patronages, the top supporters of the month, and the evolution of support and active creators for each month over the last year, while monitoring the recent transactions that are being conducted within various creator communities.

There are many benefits to having the CryptoPatronage project fully operational:

- It offers a clear overview of the long-term support being provided across various creators, by aggregating all necessary data in one place.
- Acknowledges the supporters of the month.
- Displays the active creators for each month over the last year.
- Shows the evolution of the number of transactions made on the platform by supporters.
- Outlines the recent transactions and support commitments, showcasing the patronage system as a viable and sustainable payment model for creators.
