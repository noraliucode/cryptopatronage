### Overview

#### Why CryptoPatronage Payment System

In early 2022, we started an experiment that would turn into the Shokunin Network, with a core premise that resource distribution in the Kusama Network ecosystem was too centralized and bottlenecked on majority agreement.

#### What is CryptoPatronage Payment System

CryptoPatronage is a platform that helps creators build a membership program by offering their followers exclusive content and a closer connection with their community.

### Project Details

#### For Patrons
Publicly show your support and commitment to your chosen creators.
Have confidence that your support will go directly to a creator with no middleman, and that you will spend no more than you have committed.
Become known to those you support - and potentially be rewarded for it.
We do not yet provide a service to support with cash or credit/debit, so if that is what the creators you support want or need, we are likely not the right solution for them, or you!

#### For Creators
There are many options in the cryptocurrency ecosystem to monetize your work and make an income regardless of where you are and what you do - CryptoPatronage simply tries to provide a more human and considerate approach, based on the needs of real creators, instead of assuming all of your work can be tokenized as an NFT.

CryptoPatronage is similar to token streaming protocols that already exist, but with permissionless discovery that allows potential supporters to discover your profile and support you on-platform, alongside ways to link directly to your profile from off-platform, similarly to our non-blockchain-based equivalents.

By default, we take no platform fees, and you only pay blockchain transaction fees when pulling your earnings from supporters - which, on the networks we operate on, are negligible, even for creators not based in affluent locales.

If you want to have an experience similar to traditional crowdfunding websites, we (will soon) provide automatic payment execution as an always-optional, fee-added service, at a rate that outcompetes all comparable non-blockchain-based equivalents.

### Infrastructure

#### why we use pure proxy:
<img width="821" alt="image" src="https://github.com/noraliucode/cryptopatronage/assets/12429503/800e1d78-ee6a-4d60-98c2-8c2f1b21abf2">
<br/>A creator utilizes a Pure Proxy, a keyless and non-deterministic account set up by a Supporter. This proxy acts as an intermediary for operations, enhancing security by preventing the direct access to supporter's account. The decentralized nature of this proxy, which operates without central ownership or a private key, serves to protect the identity and credentials of the original account holder in blockchain interactions.

<br/>The dApp has a front-end built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, served to users via a browser. The backend runs on Node.js and is deployed using Vercel, which also manages scheduled tasks through cron jobs. The system interfaces with a database for data storage and employs the Polkadot.js library to interact with the Polkadot blockchain network via JSON-RPC calls. This setup enables blockchain-related functionalities for users accessing the platform.


### Ecosystem Fit

CryptoPatronage carves a niche in the blockchain space, focusing on a direct, bankless membership model for content creators within the Polkadot network. This precise approach is ideal for creators seeking immediate support from their community, ensuring transparency and lower fees than traditional support systems. It resonates with users in crypto-friendly regions or communities, bypassing the need for traditional banking. Although there is some functional overlap with Subsocial within the Polkadot ecosystem, which includes a similar feature, CryptoPatronage distinguishes itself from other tools in it's vertical by catering to users who either prefer or require operating without a bank account.

## Development Status

https://patronage.shokunin.network/

The cryptoPatronage dApp is now active and can be accessed via the provided link. Presently, there are creators signed up on the platform who are receiving funds by supporters through our patronage system.

## Future Plans

## FAQ

> Why not use Patreon?

Our application emphasizes the unique demand for cryptopatronage in serving real-world communities. We are driven by a genuine desire to support our peers who lack access to traditional banking facilities, enabling them to monetize their online presence. Utilizing Polkadot technology was the most accessible solution, extending beyond the Polkadot community itself. Our platform caters to individuals for whom Patreon is not an option. Additionally, we offer a highly competitive fee structure compared to existing services.

> How is user data stored?

User data is maintained in two distinct ways depending on the creator's preference. Those who operate on-chain have their identity information secured within the blockchain. Meanwhile, creators preferring an off-chain, more traditional web experience initially have their details housed in a centralized database. Nonetheless, they retain the option to transition their data to the blockchain as they grow more accustomed to the web3 environment.
