## Technological Overview
### @polkadot/api
```
// Import
const { ApiPromise, WsProvider } = require('@polkadot/api');
...
```
In this project we use the [[ApiPromise]] interface version of the API.
```
apiService.ts
```
The apiService.ts is the service provides all of the functionality used to add, get proxies and other functions in this dapp, It contains the following methods that enable proxy related interaction:
* **getProxies**(addressï¼šstring)
* **createAnonymousProxy**(sender: string, injector: InjectedExtension, delay: u32)
* **getBalance**(address: string)
* **getIdentity**(creator: string)
* **batchCalls**(calls: Vec<Call>)
* **removeProxies**()
### @polkadot/extension-dapp
The @polkadot/extension-dapp package includes a tool that can access and modify the window.injectedWeb3 object to obtain all the provider information that has been added to a webpage.

```javascript
import { web3Accounts, web3Enable, web3FromAddress } from '@polkadot/extension-dapp';

// returns an array of all the injected sources
// (this needs to be called first, before other requests)
const allInjected = await web3Enable('my cool dapp');

// returns an array of { address, meta: { name, source } }
// meta.source contains the name of the extension that provides this account
const allAccounts = await web3Accounts();

// the address we use to use for signing, as injected
const SENDER = '5DTestUPts3kjeXSTMyerHihn1uwMfLj8vU8sqF7qYrFabHE';

// finds an injector for an address
const injector = await web3FromAddress(SENDER);
```
